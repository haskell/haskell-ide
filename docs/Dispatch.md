## Reactor
Any notifications, requests or response messages from the client are handled
through the `Reactor` which lives inside `LspStdio.hs`. It routes these messages
to call the appropriate plugins by making `PluginRequest`s, and then responds
to the client if needed. `PluginRequest`s come in 2 flavours: `IdeRequest`
and `GhcRequest`, which take place on 2 different threads.

## Threads
The 2 threads are represented by 2 monads: `IdeM` and `IdeGhcM`.

`IdeM` should be used for anything that does not require immediate access
to ghc-mod, since `IdeGhcM` is used mainly for typechecking modules and is
the most constrained resource.

## Requests
To get onto the threads, send an `IReq` or `GReq` to the dispatcher with
`makeRequest` inside `LspStdio.hs:reactor`.

## Responses
If you are on `IdeM` and need access to a cached module, consider using an
`IdeResponseDeferred`. You can provide it with a `FilePath` to a module you
want, and your callback will be called with the module whenever `IdeGhcM`
has loaded it.
It is advised that you do not return an `IdeResponseDeferred` directly though,
and instead use one of the `withCachedModule` or `withCachedModuleAndData`
helper functions instead.

## Results
An `IdeResponse` will eventually return an `IdeResult` at the end of the day,
which will hand back data to the Reactor. `IdeGhcM` skips the response part
and returns an `IdeResult` directly since it will never need to be deferred.
